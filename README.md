Another DDB DM Screen

## Installation Instructions

### Generic Web Host

1. Upload the contents of the [public](public) directory to your favorite web host. I'm a huge fan of [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/).
2. There is no step 2.

### Alternative Installation: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

Alternatively, you can deploy to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The [Get Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/) has all the information you need. Leave **Build command** empty and set **Build output directory.** to `public`.
